### Bits
- Classical computers use **binary bits**.

### Superposition
- The spectrum of states.

### Quantum Gates
> In quantum computing and specifically the quantum circuit model of computation, a **quantum logic gate** (or quantum gate) is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of **qubits**. Quantum logic gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.

> Unlike many classical logic gates, quantum logic gates are **reversible**. It is possible to perform classical computing using only reversible gates. For example, the reversible Toffoli gate can implement all Boolean functions, often at the cost of having to use ancilla bits. The Toffoli gate has a direct quantum equivalent, showing that quantum circuits can perform all operations performed by classical circuits.

### Measurement
- When a quibit is measured, it loses its superposition, and collapses into just a simple 0 or 1. 
(In a superposition state, a quibit can be a 0 or 1)

### Entanglement
- When qubits are entangled, their states become stronly correlated. Changing the state of one qubit would change the state of another.
