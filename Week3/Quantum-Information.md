## Classical States
- Finite and none empty sets.

## Dirac Notation
- We denote by ∣a⟩ the **column vector** having a 1 in the entry corresponding to a∈Σ, with 0 for all other entries. his vector is read as "ket" a. 
- Vectors of this form are called **standard basis vectors**.

## Classical Operations
### Deterministic Operation

> A **deterministic system** is a system in which **no randomness** is involved in the development of future states of the system. A deterministic model will thus always produce the same output from a given starting condition or initial state.

## Probabilistic States
- **Probabilistic states** of compound systems associate probabilities with the Cartesian product of the classical state sets of the indivisual systems.
