* Intro to Qiskit using Python (Feb.20th to Mar.1st).
* Setup Python communication with Qiskit REST API: 3 weeks (Feb.20th to Mar.8th).
### Frontend Research: P5.js (Mar.9th to Apr.14th)
* Setup P5.js sketch to enable communication with Python backend server: 1 week (Mar.9th to Mar.16th)
* P5.js experiments with waves: 2 weeks (Mar.17th to Mar.31st)
* P5.js experiments with particles: 2 weeks (Apr.1st to Apr.14th)
### Fullstack Optimization: Python Server (Apr.15th to May 15th)
* Python server testings optimization along with more P5.js sketch experiments: 3 weeks (Apr.22nd to May 15th)

# Research Outcomes
To run all the examples, you need to set up a Python environment, and run these command lines to install required packages:
```
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
And then, you can run the FastAPI server with Uvicorn:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
