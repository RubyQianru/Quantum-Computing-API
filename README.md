# Research Outcomes

All the P5 sketches are based upon Daniel Shiffman's [The Nature of Code - Randomness](https://natureofcode.com/random/)

To run all the examples, you need to set up a Python environment, and run these command lines to install required packages:
```
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
And then, you can run the FastAPI server with Uvicorn:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
